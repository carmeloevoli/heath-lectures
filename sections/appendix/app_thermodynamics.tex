\section{Thermodynamics of Adiabatic Processes}
\label{app:thermo}

An \emph{adiabatic process} is characterized by the absence of heat exchange between the system and its surroundings, mathematically expressed as \( \delta Q = 0 \). From the \emph{first law of thermodynamics}, we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:firstlaw}
d\mathcal{U} + P dV = 0,
\end{equation}
where \( \mathcal{U} \) is the internal energy of the system, \( P \) is the pressure, and \( V \) is the volume. This implies that work done by the system (\( P dV \)) must be entirely compensated by a change in its internal energy (\( d\mathcal{U} \)).

For an ideal gas, which follows the equation of state \( P V = n R T \) (\( R \) is the universal gas constant), the internal energy is solely a function of temperature and is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nrt}
\mathcal{U} = \alpha n R T = \alpha P V,
\end{equation}
where \( n \) is the number of moles, and \( \alpha = \frac{f}{2} \), with \( f \) being the number of degrees of freedom.

Differentiating \( \mathcal{U} \):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dunrdt}
d\mathcal{U} = \alpha n R dT = \alpha (P dV + V dP),
\end{equation}
where we used the ideal gas law to relate \( dT \) to changes in \( P \) and \( V \).

Substituting \( d\mathcal{U} \) from Equation~\ref{eq:dunrdt} into the first law (Equation~\ref{eq:firstlaw}), we get:
\begin{equation}
- P dV = \alpha (P dV + V dP).
\end{equation}
Rearranging terms:
\begin{equation}
-(\alpha + 1) \frac{dV}{V} = \alpha \frac{dP}{P}.
\end{equation}

Integrating both sides:
\begin{equation}
\ln \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) = - \frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha} \ln \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right),
\end{equation}
or equivalently:
\begin{equation}
P V^{\gamma_g} = \text{constant},
\end{equation}
where \( \gamma_g = \frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha} = \frac{c_P}{c_V} \) is the \emph{heat capacity ratio}. 
%
This relationship, known as the \emph{polytropic equation}, characterizes a reversible adiabatic process.

#### Ideal Gas Internal Energy
#### Derivation of Adiabatic Condition

#### Internal Energy in Terms of Volume and Pressure
The internal energy for an ideal gas can also be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U} = n c_V T = \frac{P V}{\gamma_g - 1}.
\end{equation}
Dividing by volume, we get the **internal energy density**:
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{\mathcal{U}}{V} = \frac{P}{\gamma_g - 1}.
\end{equation}

#### Enthalpy and Specific Enthalpy
The **enthalpy** \( \mathcal{H} \) is defined as:
\[
\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{U} + P V.
\]
Dividing by volume, the **enthalpy density** becomes:
\[
\frac{\mathcal{H}}{V} = u + P.
\]

To express enthalpy per unit mass, we introduce the specific internal energy \( \epsilon = \frac{u}{\rho} \), where \( \rho \) is the density. The **specific enthalpy** is:
\begin{equation}
h = \epsilon + \frac{P}{\rho}.
\end{equation}

#### Entropy in Adiabatic Processes
In a reversible adiabatic process, entropy remains constant. The specific entropy \( s \) satisfies:
\[
\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \nabla s = 0.
\]
For a compressible fluid, the conservation of entropy per unit volume (\( \rho s \)) can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial (\rho s)}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho s \vec{u}) = 0.
\end{equation}

#### Momentum and Energy Conservation
Using the ideal gas law and the specific internal energy:
\[
\epsilon = \frac{1}{\gamma_g - 1} \frac{P}{\rho},
\]
the momentum conservation equation links pressure gradients to the acceleration of the fluid:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial \vec{u}}{\partial t} + \vec{u} \cdot \nabla \vec{u} = -\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}.
\end{equation}

An adiabatic process is defined by the absence of heat transfer to or from the system \( \delta Q = 0 \). According to the first law of thermodynamics:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:firstlaw}
d\mathcal U + PdV = 0
\end{equation}
This equation implies that any work (\(PdV\)) performed must be compensated by a change in the internal energy (\(\mathcal U\)), as no heat is exchanged with the surroundings.

For an ideal gas, obeying the equation of state \(PV = nRT\) (where \(R\) is the universal gas constant), the internal energy is given by:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nrt} 
\mathcal U = \alpha n R T = \alpha PV 
\end{equation}
Here, \(n\) represents the number of moles, and \( \alpha \) is the number of degrees of freedom divided by 2.

Differentiating Equation~\ref{eq:nrt} results in:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dunrdt}
d\mathcal U = \alpha n R dT = \alpha (P dV + V dP)
\end{equation}

Substituting this into Equation~\ref{eq:firstlaw} yields:
\begin{equation}
- PdV = \alpha P dV + \alpha V dP \rightarrow -(\alpha + 1) \frac{dV}{V} = \alpha \frac{dP}{P}
\end{equation}

Integrating both sides of this equation, we get:
\begin{equation}
\ln \left( \frac{P}{P_0} \right) = - \frac{\alpha + 1}{\alpha} \ln \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right) = - \gamma_g \ln \left( \frac{V}{V_0} \right)
\end{equation}
where \( \gamma_g \) is the heat capacity ratio, \( c_V = \alpha R \), and we have used Mayer's relation \(c_P - c_V = R\).

Thus, a reversible adiabatic process (one with no entropy generation) can be characterized by the polytropic process equation:
\begin{remark}
\begin{equation}
PV^\gamma = \text{constant}
\end{equation}
\end{remark}
%%% END CGPT

Notice that for an ideal gas the \emph{internal energy} is solely a function of temperature. Indeed, from Eq.~\ref{eq:nrt}, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal U = n c_V T = \frac{PV}{\gamma_g - 1}
\end{equation}

Thus, expressing internal energy per unit volume as \(u\), we get:
%
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{\mathcal U}{V} = \frac{P}{\gamma_g - 1}
\end{equation}

On the other hand, \emph{enthalpy} \( \mathcal H\) is defined as:
\[
\mathcal H = \mathcal U + PV \rightarrow  \frac{\mathcal H}{V} = u + P
\]

Employing the relation \(u = \rho \epsilon\) (where \(\rho\) is the density and \(\epsilon\) is the \emph{specific} internal energy, i.e., energy per unit mass), we derive the \emph{specific} enthalpy:
\begin{remark}
\begin{equation}
h = \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\mathcal H}{V} = \epsilon + \frac{P}{\rho}
\end{equation}
\end{remark}

% Last the first law of thermodynamics states that
% \[
% dU=TdS-PdV
% \]
% with $S$ the entropy,  which is conserved (so $dS=0$).  If we divide by mass we obtain the specific quantities,  namely
% \[
% d\epsilon=-Pd\left(\frac{1}{\rho}  \right)
% \]
%
% Therefore:
% \[
% dw = d\epsilon +\frac{dP}{\rho}+P d\left(\frac{1}{\rho}  \right)=\frac{dP}{\rho}
% \]
%
%
%Noting that $U = \frac{P}{\rho (\gamma âˆ’ 1)}$ from ideal gas law, with $U$ internal energy per unit mass.
%
%Now introduce the entropy per unit mass $s$,  satisfying the adiabatic condition
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial s}{\partial z}=0
%\end{equation}
%Entropy per unit volume would be $\rho s$,  so that we can write (questa si puo derivare ma u e' costante o no?)
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial (\rho s)}{\partial t}+\vec{\nabla}(\rho s\vec{u}) =0 \underset{1d}{\implies} \frac{\partial (\rho s)}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}(\rho su) =0 
%\end{equation}
%
%The \textbf{enthalpy} of the system is \[ \mathcal W = E + PV \], while the specific enthalpy is \[ w=\epsilon +\frac{P}{\rho} \].
%
%Therefore
%\begin{equation}
%dw=d\epsilon +d\left(\frac{P}{\rho} \right)
%\end{equation}
%On the other hand
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
% dE &= dQ-PdV\\
%&=\cancel{TdS} -PdV\\
%\implies d\epsilon &=-Pd\left(\frac{1}{\rho}\right)\\
%&=\frac{P}{\rho^2}d\rho
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\implies
%dw=\frac{P}{\rho^2}d\rho +\frac{dP}{\rho}-\frac{P}{\rho^2}d\rho =\frac{dP}{\rho}
%\end{equation}
%Now we can use again the conservation of momentum and write:
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}=-\frac{\nabla P}{\rho}\equiv \nabla \left[\epsilon +\frac{P}{\rho}  \right]
%\end{equation}
%Remember the energy density per unit volume
%\begin{equation}
%u=\frac{P}{\gamma_g -1}=\rho\epsilon \implies \epsilon =\frac{1}{\gamma_g -1}\frac{P}{\rho}
%\end{equation}
