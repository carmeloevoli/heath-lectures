\section{Where do Alfv\'en waves come from in the Milky Way?}
\subsection{Large–scale driving and the turbulence cascade}

Magnetized turbulence in the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM) is continually stirred on large scales by energetic processes (e.g.\ clustered supernovae, expanding superbubbles, Galactic shear). Whatever the detailed mechanism, the key point is that energy is \emph{injected} into the plasma at some outer scale \(L \sim 10 \)~pc with a characteristic velocity fluctuation \(u_L\). From there, nonlinear interactions transfer this energy to progressively smaller eddies and wave packets. This scale-to-scale transfer is the \emph{cascade}. 

Between the outer (forcing) scale \(L\) and the microscopic \emph{dissipation} scale \(\ell_{\rm d}\) (where viscosity, resistivity, or kinetic effects finally convert turbulent energy into heat), the dynamics are dominated by nonlinear advection and are largely insensitive to the details of forcing or dissipation. This interval of scales \( \ell_{\rm d} \ll \ell \ll L \) is the \emph{inertial range}. Statistics in this range are expected to be \emph{universal}, set primarily by the mean energy flux \(\varepsilon\) cascading through scales (energy per unit mass per unit time).

\paragraph{Kolmogorov’s dimensional argument (hydrodynamic baseline).}
Kolmogorov (1941) reasoned that, in the inertial range, the only relevant quantities for an eddy of size \(\ell\) are its velocity amplitude \(u_\ell\) and the constant energy flux \(\varepsilon\). Dimensional analysis gives
\[
\varepsilon \sim \frac{u_\ell^2}{\tau_\ell}\sim \frac{u_\ell^3}{\ell}
\quad\rightarrow\quad
u_\ell \sim (\varepsilon\,\ell)^{1/3},\quad 
\tau_\ell \sim \frac{\ell}{u_\ell} \sim \varepsilon^{-1/3}\,\ell^{2/3}.
\]
Defining the one-dimensional energy spectrum \(E(k)\) by
\[
\frac{1}{2}\langle u^2\rangle \;=\; \int_0^\infty E(k)\,{\rm d}k,
\]
and using the correspondence \(\ell\sim k^{-1}\), the velocity at scale \(k\) scales as \(u_k^2\sim k\,E(k)\). 
%
Substituting \(u_k\sim (\varepsilon k^{-1})^{1/3}\) gives the celebrated inertial-range spectrum
\begin{remark}
\[
E(k)\;=\; C_K\,\varepsilon^{2/3}\,k^{-5/3}
\]
\end{remark}
with \(C_K\) an order-unity constant. The essence is: a constant energy flux \(\varepsilon\) through scales, an eddy turnover time \(\tau_\ell\sim\ell/u_\ell\), and no dependence on forcing or dissipation details.

This is called \emph{Kolmogorov spectrum law or the -5/3 law}.

\paragraph{From hydrodynamics to MHD: Alfv\'enic cascades.}
In a magnetized plasma the turbulence can be decomposed into Alfvénic and compressive (magnetosonic) parts. The Alfvénic component---incompressible, transverse perturbations tied to the mean magnetic field \(\mathbf B_0\)---dominates much of the ISM cascade. Nonlinear interactions transfer energy mainly by \emph{distorting} counter-propagating Alfvén wave packets. 

Two classic consequences follow:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The cascade is \emph{anisotropic}: eddies become increasingly elongated along \(\mathbf B_0\). In modern language (Goldreich–Sridhar), \emph{critical balance} relates the linear Alfvén time \( (k_\parallel v_A)^{-1} \) to the nonlinear time \( (k_\perp u_{k_\perp})^{-1} \), producing a Kolmogorov-like spectrum \emph{in the perpendicular direction}, \(E(k_\perp)\propto \varepsilon^{2/3}k_\perp^{-5/3}\).
  \item Magnetic and kinetic energies tend toward near-equipartition within the Alfvénic cascade, so the same scaling applies (up to constants) to \(\delta\mathbf v\) and \(\delta\mathbf B\) fluctuations.
\end{itemize}
Older phenomenology (Iroshnikov–Kraichnan) predicts a slightly shallower slope \(k^{-3/2}\) owing to weakened interactions; observations and simulations in many astrophysical settings favor a Kolmogorov-like \(-5/3\) spectrum in \(k_\perp\), with anisotropy set by the mean field strength.

\paragraph{What the inertial range means physically.}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Universality:} statistics at \(\ell\) depend only on \(\varepsilon\) (and, in MHD, on the direction relative to \(\mathbf B_0\)), not on how the turbulence was stirred or how it will ultimately dissipate.
  \item \textbf{Self-similar cascade:} energy injected near \(L\) passes through a hierarchy of eddies/wave packets with turnover time \(\tau_\ell\propto \ell^{2/3}\) until it reaches \(\ell_{\rm d}\), where microphysics takes over.
  \item \textbf{Spectral signature:} a power-law energy spectrum—\(E(k)\propto k^{-5/3}\) for hydrodynamic turbulence; in MHD, the same \(-5/3\) scaling appears in the \emph{perpendicular} spectrum of Alfvénic turbulence, with anisotropy \(k_\parallel \ll k_\perp\) that strengthens toward small scales.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Takeaway for the Milky Way.}
Large-scale Galactic driving maintains a steady energy flux \(\varepsilon\) into the ISM. In the inertial range, that flux feeds an anisotropic Alfvénic cascade with a Kolmogorov-like perpendicular spectrum. The resulting sea of broadband Alfvénic fluctuations is the natural reservoir of ``where Alfvén waves come from’’ in the Galaxy: they are not produced one frequency at a time, but emerge continuously from the nonlinear cascade that carries energy from \(L\) down to the dissipation scale.

\begin{remark}{Turbulent energy and timescales in the ISM.}

Observations and theory indicate that the Galactic ISM is stirred on large scales by superbubbles and clustered supernovae~\ref{2004Ap&SS.289..323M}. A typical baseline is an outer (forcing) scale \(L\equiv l_0\simeq 100~\mathrm{pc}\) with a characteristic velocity comparable to the sound speed of the warm phases,
\(u_0\sim c_s\simeq 10~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}\).

In a Kolmogorov‐type cascade the flow sheds energy at roughly one eddy per scale, so the global decay time of turbulence is set by the turnover time of the largest eddies,
\[
\tau_0 \sim \frac{l_0}{u_0}
\;\simeq\; 10^{7}~\mathrm{yr}.
\]
Thus, even if microscopic dissipation is weak, sustained turbulence requires continuous driving on $\sim$Myr timescales.

The corresponding (mass‐specific) energy flux through scales is
\(\varepsilon \sim u_0^{3}/l_0\),
so the \emph{volumetric} turbulent dissipation rate is
\[
\epsilon_{\rm turb} \sim \rho\,\frac{u_0^{3}}{l_0}.
\]
Adopting a representative warm–ISM density \(n\simeq 1~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\) and
\(\rho\simeq 1.4\,m_p n \approx 2.3\times10^{-24}~\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}\),
one obtains
\[
\epsilon_{\rm turb}\;\approx\; 8\times10^{-27}\ \mathrm{erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}.
\]

To compare with the available power from supernovae, distribute the SN mechanical luminosity over the star–forming disc volume
\(V\simeq 2\pi h R_d^2\),
with scale height \(h\simeq 100~\mathrm{pc}\) and radius \(R_d\simeq 10~\mathrm{kpc}\).
Using \(E_{\rm SN}=10^{51}~\mathrm{erg}\) and a Galactic rate
\(\mathcal R_{\rm SN}\simeq 1/50~\mathrm{yr^{-1}}\),
\[
\epsilon_{\rm SN}
=\frac{E_{\rm SN}\,\mathcal R_{\rm SN}}{2\pi h R_d^2}
\;\approx\;
3.4\times10^{-25}\ \mathrm{erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}.
\]

Is there enough power to maintain the cascade?
The ratio
\(
\tfrac{\epsilon_{\rm turb}}{\epsilon_{\rm SN}} \approx 0.02
\)
shows that only a \(\sim\!2\text{–}3\%\) coupling of SN mechanical energy into turbulent motions is sufficient—comfortably plausible given other sinks (radiation, cosmic rays, winds). In short, with \(L\sim100\ \mathrm{pc}\) and \(u_0\sim10\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}\), the ISM would decay its turbulence in \(\sim10\) Myr unless it is continuously powered, and ordinary supernova activity can readily supply the needed \(\sim10^{-26} \, \mathrm{erg\,cm^{-3}\,s^{-1}}\).
\end{remark}

\subsection{Self–generated Alfv\'en waves: Kulsrud’s argument}

Cosmic rays (CRs) move individually at \(v\simeq c\), but on average they drift slightly
along the large–scale magnetic field \(\mathbf B_0\) with bulk speed \(v_D\) set by their
pressure gradient. If \(v_D>v_A\), a small pitch–angle anisotropy develops that
resonantly excites forward–propagating Alfv\'en waves. Those waves scatter the CRs in
pitch angle until, in the wave frame, the distribution becomes nearly isotropic. During
this relaxation the CRs lose \emph{parallel} momentum to the waves/plasma and their bulk
drift relaxes from \(v_D\) toward \(v_A\). In this way, super–Alfv\'enic CR streaming
\emph{self–generates} the very Alfv\'enic turbulence that ultimately limits the
streaming speed.

\paragraph{Momentum bookkeeping (step by step).}
Kulsrud’s argument quantifies the transfer without detailed wave–particle kinetics by
tracking the parallel momentum budget.

\emph{(i) CR parallel momentum before/after isotropization.}
Let \(P_{\rm cr}\) denote the CR parallel momentum density (per unit volume) for the
particles that resonate with waves of wavenumber \(k\), i.e.\ those with
\(p>p_{\rm res}(k)\).
Before isotropization (bulk drift \(v_D\)),
\[
P_{\rm cr}^{\rm before} \;=\; n_{\rm CR}(>p_{\rm res})\,m_p\,\gamma\,v_D,
\]
and after isotropization in the wave frame (which corresponds to net parallel velocity
\(v_A\) in the lab frame),
\[
P_{\rm cr}^{\rm after} \;=\; n_{\rm CR}(>p_{\rm res})\,m_p\,\gamma\,v_A.
\]
Hence the change (with \(n_{\rm CR}\equiv n_{\rm CR}(>p_{\rm res})\) for brevity) is
\[
\Delta P_{\rm cr} \;=\; n_{\rm CR}\,m_p\,\gamma\,(v_A - v_D)\;<\;0\qquad (v_D>v_A).
\]

\emph{(ii) Relaxation rate from pitch–angle scattering.}
Pitch–angle diffusion with coefficient \(D_{\mu\mu}\) isotropizes the distribution at
rate \(\tau^{-1}\!\sim\!D_{\mu\mu}\). Therefore the CR parallel momentum decays as
\[
\frac{dP_{\rm cr}}{dt}
\;\simeq\;
-\,D_{\mu\mu}\,n_{\rm CR}\,m_p\,\gamma\,(v_D - v_A).
\]

\emph{(iii) Waves gain the lost momentum; relate momentum to wave energy.}
By momentum conservation the waves/plasma gain the same amount:
\[
\frac{dP_{w}}{dt}
\;=\;
-\,\frac{dP_{\rm cr}}{dt}.
\]
For a (linear) Alfv\'en wave, magnetic and kinetic perturbation energies are equal on
average, so if \(W\equiv \delta B^2/(8\pi)\) is the magnetic part of the wave energy
density, the total wave energy density is \(E_{\rm tot}=2W\). The wave momentum density
is then \(P_w=E_{\rm tot}/v_A=2W/v_A\). Differentiating gives
\[
\frac{dW}{dt}\;=\;\frac{v_A}{2}\,D_{\mu\mu}\,n_{\rm CR}\,m_p\,\gamma\,(v_D - v_A)\;>\;0\~.
\]

\emph{(iv) From \(D_{\mu\mu}\) to a growth rate \(\Gamma_w(k)\).}
At resonance, quasi–linear theory gives
\(D_{\mu\mu}(k)\propto \Omega_p\,(\delta B_k/B_0)^2\), with \(\delta B_k\) the wave amplitude near \(k\).
Writing the spectral energy growth in the standard linear form
\(\partial_t W_k=2\,\Gamma_w(k)\,W_k\) and using \(W_k\propto \delta B_k^2\) yields
\begin{remark}
\[
\Gamma_w(k)
\;\propto\;
\Omega\,
\frac{n_{\rm CR}(>p_{\rm res})}{n_i}\,
\Bigl(\frac{v_D}{v_A}-1\Bigr),
\quad
p_{\rm res}=\frac{Ze\,B_0}{k\,c}~.
\]
\end{remark}
%
with \(\Omega_p=eB_0/(m_pc)\) and \(n_i\) the ion number density.

%Including the order–unity angular/spectral factors restores the familiar coefficient,
%\[
%\Gamma_w(k)
%\;=\;
%\frac{\pi}{4}\,\Omega_p\,
%\frac{n_{\rm CR}(>p_{\rm res})}{n_i}\,
%\Bigl(\frac{v_D}{v_A}-1\Bigr),
%\]
%with \(\Omega_p=eB_0/(m_pc)\) and \(n_i\) the ion number density.

\paragraph{ISM scale estimate.}
As a reference for the warm ISM, take \(B_0=5~\mu\mathrm{G}\) and \(n_i\simeq
1~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\), giving \(\Omega_p\simeq 0.05~\mathrm{s^{-1}}\).
For resonant CRs near a few GeV, a representative integrated density is
\(n_{\rm CR}(>p_{\rm res})\sim 10^{-10}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\).
If streaming is moderately super–Alfv\'enic, \(v_D\simeq 2v_A\), then
\[
\Gamma_w \;\approx\; 1.3\times10^{-4}~\mathrm{yr^{-1}},
\]
so the growth time \(\Gamma_w^{-1}\sim 10~\mathrm{kyr}\) is orders of magnitude shorter
than CR residence times. Where damping is not dominant, CRs can therefore
\emph{self–generate} the Alfv\'enic turbulence that regulates their drift to \(v_A\).

\paragraph{Takeaway.}
Super–Alfv\'enic CR streaming is unstable. Parallel momentum lost by CRs on the
scattering time is transferred to Alfv\'en waves, whose energy grows until balanced by
damping. The steady amplitude at each \(k\) satisfies
\(\Gamma_w(k)=\Gamma_{\rm damp}(k)\); the resulting spectrum sets the scattering rate
\(D_{\mu\mu}(p)\) and the parallel diffusion coefficient \(\kappa_\parallel(p)\), thus
closing the feedback loop between CR transport and their self–generated turbulence.

\subsection{Self–generated Alfv\'en waves: Kulsrud’s argument}

Cosmic rays (CRs) move individually at \(v\simeq c\), but on average they drift a little along the large–scale magnetic field \(\mathbf B_0\) with bulk speed \(v_D\) set by their
pressure gradient. If \(v_D>v_A\), the CR pitch–angle distribution acquires a small anisotropy that resonantly excites forward–propagating Alfv\'en waves. Those waves
scatter the CRs in pitch angle until, in the wave frame, the distribution becomes nearly isotropic. During this relaxation the CRs lose \emph{parallel} momentum to the
waves/plasma, and their bulk drift is reduced from \(v_D\) toward \(v_A\). Thus super–Alfv\'enic CR streaming \emph{self–generates} the very Alfv\'enic turbulence
that ultimately limits the streaming speed.

\paragraph{Momentum bookkeeping (step by step).}

Kulsrud’s argument captures the transfer of energy from cosmic rays to Alfv\'en waves without needing the detailed wave–particle kinetics.

Let \(P_{\rm cr}\) denote the cosmic ray parallel momentum density before the isotropization when they stream with a drift velocity \( v_D \)
%
\[
P_{\rm cr}^{\rm before} = n_{\rm CR}(p > p_{\rm res}) m_p \gamma v_D
\]
after isotropization in the wave frame, they have (in the Galaxy frame) a net velocity of \(v_A\), then their momentum is
\[
P_{\rm cr}^{\rm after} = n_{\rm CR}(p > p_{\rm res}) m_p \gamma v_A
\]
%
where \( n_{\rm CR}(p > p_{\rm res}) \) is the number density of CRs above the resonant momentum.

Then this process implies a parallel momentum change of the order of (I simplify the notation for \( n_CR \) by dropping \( p > p_res \)):
%
\[
dP_{\rm cr} = n_{\rm CR} m_p \gamma (v_A - v_D) < 0
\]

We remind that pitch–angle scattering with diffusion coefficient \(D_{\mu\mu}\) isotropizes
the distribution at a rate \( \tau^{-1} \;\sim\; D_{\mu\mu} \), which implies that the momentum lost per isotropization time is 
\[
\frac{dP_{\rm cr}}{dt}\;\simeq\; -  D_{\mu\mu}  n_{\rm CR} m_p \gamma (v_D - v_A)
\]

By momentum conservation the waves gain the same parallel momentum:
\[
\frac{dP_{w}}{dt}\;=-\frac{dP_{\rm cr}}{dt}
\]

Remember that for a Alfv\'en wave, the \emph{wave momentum density} and \emph{magnetic energy
density} \( W \equiv \frac{\delta B^2}{8\pi}  \) are related by
\[
P_{w} \;=\; \frac{E_{\rm tot}}{v_A} \;=\; \frac{2W}{v_A},
\]
because magnetic and kinetic energies are equal on average (\(E_{\rm tot}=2W\)) and the Alfv\'en Poynting flux is \(S=v_A E_{\rm tot}\).

Therefore the \emph{power per unit volume} that goes into waves becomes
\[
\frac{dW}{dt}\;=\; -\frac{v_A}{2} \frac{dP_{\rm cr}}{dt}
\]

Writing the growth in the standard linear form
\(\partial_t W_k = 2\,\Gamma_w(k)\,W_k\) with \(W_k\propto \delta B_k^2\)
and reminding that quasi–linear theory gives
\(
D_{\mu\mu}(k) \;\propto\; \Omega\,\left(\frac{\delta B_k}{B_0}\right)^{\!2},
\)
immediately yields
\begin{remark}
\[
\Gamma_w(k)\;\propto\;\Omega\,
\frac{n_{\rm cr}(>p_{\rm res})}{n_i}\,
\Bigl(\frac{v_D}{v_A}-1\Bigr)\,~.
\]
\end{remark}

\paragraph{ISM scale estimate.}
Take a warm–ISM reference point: \(B_0=5~\mu\mathrm G\),
\(n_i\simeq 1~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\Rightarrow \Omega_p\simeq 0.05~\mathrm{s^{-1}}\).
For resonant CRs near a few GeV, a typical integrated density is
\(n_{\rm cr}(>p_{\rm res})\sim 10^{-10}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}\).
If streaming is moderately super–Alfv\'enic, say \(v_D\simeq 2v_A\), then
\[
\Gamma_w \;\approx\; 1.3\times10^{-4}~\mathrm{yr^{-1}}.
\]
The corresponding growth time, \( \Gamma_w^{-1}\sim 10~\mathrm{kyr}\), is orders of magnitude shorter than CR residence times in the Galaxy, so in regions
where damping is not overwhelming the CRs can indeed \emph{self–generate} the Alfv\'enic turbulence that regulates their own drift to \(v_A\).

\paragraph{Takeaway.}
Super–Alfv\'enic CR streaming is unstable. Resonant wave growth taps the CR pressure
gradient until pitch–angle scattering reduces the drift to \(v_A\). The steady wave
amplitude at each \(k\) is set by the balance \(\gamma(k)=\Gamma_{\rm damp}(k)\); the
resulting spectrum governs the scattering rate and thus the CR transport.

\paragraph{What sets the amplitude in the ISM.}
In different phases of the ISM the relevant damping can be ion–neutral friction, non-linear Landau damping, turbulent damping by the ambient cascade, or simple collisional/resistive losses.
Balancing $\gamma(k)$ against the dominant $\Gamma_{\rm damp}(k)$ fixes $\delta B(k)$ (via $W=\delta B^2/8\pi$) and thus the local scattering rate $D_{\mu\mu}(p)$ and parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel(p)$—closing the loop between CR transport and their self-generated turbulence.
